# **App Name**: DocuProto

## Core Features:

- Figma Prototype Embedding: Embed the Figma prototype using the Figma Embed API based on the provided URL: https://www.figma.com/proto/Qy1SqTQFBGy0MbDona2oA5/Finance-Management-Mobile-App-UI-UX-Kit-for-Budget-Tracker-Financial-Prototype-Design--Community-?node-id=7113-2955&p=f&t=iSAURmcpt7d32xlC-1&scaling=min-zoom&content-scaling=fixed&page-id=7020%3A3430&starting-point-node-id=7113%3A2955&show-proto-sidebar=1.
- iOS Documentation Display: Display iOS documentation alongside the Figma prototype, structured for easy reading. Use dummy data.
- Bi-Directional Navigation: Implement two-way navigation: Clicking on elements in the Figma prototype updates the displayed documentation, and controls in the documentation can navigate the Figma prototype. Callbacks should be handled so that documentation updates properly.
- Content Structure and Navigation: Provide a clear structure with navigation menus for easy access to different sections of the documentation.
- Responsive Design: Ensure the documentation is responsive and accessible on various devices and screen sizes.
- Contextual Documentation Suggestions: Use a tool to intelligently suggest related documentation snippets based on the current context and user interactions.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: A muted blue (#6699CC) to create a calm and trustworthy environment suitable for technical documentation.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F0F0) to reduce eye strain during long reading sessions.
- Accent color: A soft orange (#E08E49) to highlight interactive elements and important information.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable text.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a computerized, techy, scientific feel.
- Use a set of consistent, simple line icons to represent different documentation sections and interactive elements.
- A clean and structured layout with a sidebar for navigation, a main content area for documentation, and an embedded Figma prototype area.
- Subtle transitions and animations to provide feedback on user interactions, like expanding sections or navigating the Figma prototype.
